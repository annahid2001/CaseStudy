##Introduction

The data project seeks to explore world economic and social indicators of major countries. In this project, the goal is to carry out an exploratory data analysis using two data set, GDP data and Educational data.These data sets will be downloaded from the world bank website. Original datas set are in the links below

GDP data

Education data

This CaseStudy involves 3 steps:

Cleaning dataset
Analysing dataset
Visualizing dataset

###To begin-> load the required package and download the dataset into R.

Loading required package:
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(data.table)

Download data from URL

GDPurl <-  "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv"
download.file(GDPurl, "GDP.csv", quiet=TRUE)

EduURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv"
download.file(EduURL, "Edu.csv", quiet=TRUE)
###Part1...Data Cleaning

Read files into dataframe. Using the "read_csv" from readr package helps eliminate the need to use stringasFactors= F

GDP.data <- read_csv("GDP.csv",skip =3)  
Educ.data <- read_csv("Edu.csv") 
##Looking at the first three rows, we see that the GDP data contains some empty and irrelevant column names

head(GDP.data,3)
###renamed and picked the relevant columns for the analysis

GDP.data <- GDP.data[, c(1, 2, 4, 5)]
GDP.data <- GDP.data[-c(1:2),]
colnames(GDP.data) <- c("Country_Code", "Rank","Country_Name","GDP_Value")
head(GDP.data,4)
###converted the character Rank and GDP_Value column in the GDP_data to Numeric and remove commas to help data manipulation

GDP.data$GDP_Value <- as.numeric(str_replace_all(GDP.data$GDP_Value,",",""))
GDP.data$Rank <- as.numeric(GDP.data$Rank)
head(GDP.data$GDP_Value,2)

###replace all empty spaces within Educ_data columns with an underscore and selected the most relevant for the analysis

colnames(Educ.data) <- str_replace_all(colnames(Educ.data)," ","_")
Educ.data <- Educ.data %>% 
  select(CountryCode,Long_Name,Short_Name, Income_Group,Region,Currency_Unit)
head(Educ.data,2)
#####Check for the number of NA's within each column of GDP datasets

The following output gives the column names and the number of NA's in each column of GDP table

sapply(GDP.data,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
####Check for the number of NA's within each column of Education datasets

The following output gives the column names and the number of NA's in each column of Education table

sapply(Educ.data,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

##Part 2 ...Data Analysis In this data analysis section, analyze the following questions

Case Study Question 1.Merge the data based on the country shortcode. How many of the IDs match?

By merging the two datasets, removed NA's and counted matching ID

There are 188 matching ID's after removing NA values.

merge_GDP_EDU <- 
  merge.data.frame(GDP.data,Educ.data, by.x = "Country_Code", by.y = "CountryCode") %>% 
  na.omit()
length(merge_GDP_EDU$Country_Code)

Case Study Question 2.Sort the data frame in ascending order by GDP (so United States is last). What is the 13th country in the resulting data frame?

The 13th country in the resulting data frame is St. Kitts and Nevis

merge_GDP_EDU <- merge_GDP_EDU %>% 
  select(everything()) %>% 
  arrange(GDP_Value) 
merge_GDP_EDU[13,3]

Case Study Question 3.What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income: nonOECD" groups?

According to the results, the average GDP rankings for the High income: nonOECD countries is 91.91304 and 34.06897 for High income: OECD countries respectively

Avg_GDP <- merge_GDP_EDU %>% 
  select(everything()) %>% 
  group_by(Income_Group) %>%
  summarise(Average_GDP = mean(Rank))%>%
  filter(Income_Group %in%  c("High income: OECD","High income: nonOECD"))
Avg_GDP

Case Study Question 5.Cut the GDP ranking into 5 separate quantile groups. Make a table versus Income.Group.

merge_GDP_EDU$Quantiles <- cut(merge_GDP_EDU$Rank, breaks=5)
table(merge_GDP_EDU$Quantiles, merge_GDP_EDU$Income_Group)

How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest GDP? 
Based on the output, there are 6 countries in the lower middle income but among the 38 nations with the highest GDP.

merge_GDP_EDU[151:189,c(1,2,3,4,7)] %>% 
  filter(Income_Group=="Lower middle income")
Part 3...Data Visualization

Case Study Question 4.Plot the GDP for all of the countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group.

There are about 189 countries in the dataset. It will not be efficient to plot all countries on the X axis therefore I group the countries by income group and plot against GDP.

ggplot(merge_GDP_EDU, aes(y = GDP_Value, x=Income_Group,fill=Income_Group)) + 
  scale_y_log10()+ 
  geom_point(pch = 21, size = 8, stat = "identity", position=position_jitter())+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "orange", "green", "blue","brown"),
                    na.value = "grey50" ) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

Conclusion.

There is no doubt that these middle income countries given the consistent rise in their GDP will one day become the engine of economic growth, prosperity, and sustainable development.
